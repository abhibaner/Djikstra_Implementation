Dijkstra Algorithm Implementation

In this project the Dijkstra algorithm has been implemented on a point and rigid robot.
Point robot file: *dijkastra_point.py*
Rigid Robot file: *dijkastra_rigid.py*

External dependencies:
Pygame. To install type command:

pip install pygame


Steps to run the program:
Change the directory on terminal using cd to the file location.

Running the point robot file: python *dijkastra_point.py*

The user will asked to input the start and goal points, in terms of x and y coordinates. The algorithm will run
once the goal is found a visual representation of the shortest path will be displayed on the screen

Running the rigid robot file: python *dijkastra_rigid.py*

The user will prompted to input the start and goal points, interms of x and y coordinates. In addition, the user will
be prompted to input the radius and clearance of the rigid robot.  The algorithm will run
once the goal is found a visual representation of the shortest path will be displayed on the screen.

Maximum time including visualization of end results is 18 mins for an Ubuntu 16.04 system, running in Python 3.7
